This is a precursor to the experimental platform the planing tool

    Responsive Epic Planner

See that project. This project lets you printout manually entered
epics in correct size so that you can cut and paste it on your physical
epic/capacity planning board.

It will choose a color for your epic randomly and print it in a single "stripe"
so to increase "height" you have to cut the epic (paper representation) in parts
and paste them along side each other. This also allows for more dynamic
variation in "height".
